it's ultra responsive to be a responsive css framework.

## What?
crystallo is a solid & simple **responsive micro framework** to help you **kick-start** any form of **web creation**.

This is the **alpha** release and it would be awesome if **you** could **help**: critique, bugs, ideas!

## Features!

* clean & semantic HTML
* class / id free
* up to 5 fluid columns

* vertical-align: center
* theme support
* and what ever you want!

## In the not so far future...
